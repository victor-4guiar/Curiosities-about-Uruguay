			<p>Despite its size, Uruguay stands out for one of its reasons, one of which is the fact that it is a progressive country and very much in favor of the LGBT community. It is also famous for having won the world cup twice.</p>
			<h2>1. Uruguay is the smallest Spanish-speaking country in South America</h2>
			<p>Suriname is the smallest country in South America, but considering that it was part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for a long time, the official language is still Dutch. Therefore, as Uruguay is the second smallest country in South America, it is the smallest country where Spanish is the main language.</p>
			<p>Uruguay also tops the lists for democracy, peace, freedom of the press, tolerance and prosperity. This is all incredible for a tiny country with far fewer residents than the rest of South America. While it may not be as well known for travel, there's nothing to lose by getting to know it!</p>

			<h2>2. Uruguay means “River of Painted Birds”</h2>
			<p>The name Uruguay comes from Guarani. Word for the Uruguay River, which means “River where the Bird Lives”, “River of Painted Birds”, “River of Snails” or “Sinuous River”. The Uruguay River forms the natural border of Argentina and Uruguay, hence the official name of the country is “Eastern Republic of Uruguay” due to its location east of Uruguay.</p>
			<p>In addition to the border between Uruguay and Argentina, the Uruguay River also forms the border between Uruguay and Brazil, starting where the Coroas River and the Pelotas River meet in Brazil, before descending to the mouth of the Rio da Prata.</p>
			<p>If you want to travel to Uruguay, a good place to visit would be the many waterfalls found at their highest points. The most famous are Moconá Falls (also known as Yucumã Falls), although just as impressive as the Iguazu Falls, a little further north in Argentina.</p>
