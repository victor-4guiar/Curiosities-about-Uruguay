			<p>Despite its size, Uruguay stands out for one of its reasons, one of which is the fact that it is a progressive country and very much in favor of the LGBT community. It is also famous for having won the world cup twice.</p>
			<h2>1. Uruguay is the smallest Spanish-speaking country in South America</h2>
			<p>Suriname is the smallest country in South America, but considering that it was part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for a long time, the official language is still Dutch. Therefore, as Uruguay is the second smallest country in South America, it is the smallest country where Spanish is the main language.</p>
			<p>Uruguay also tops the lists for democracy, peace, freedom of the press, tolerance and prosperity. This is all incredible for a tiny country with far fewer residents than the rest of South America. While it may not be as well known for travel, there's nothing to lose by getting to know it!</p>
